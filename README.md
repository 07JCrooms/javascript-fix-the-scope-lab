# JavaScript Fix the Scope Lab

## Objectives

- Explore scope in JavaScript
- Exercise bug-finding skills related to scope issues

## Instructions

In this lab, you'll need to debug some issues related to function scope in
JavaScript: variables might not be what we expect, certain variables might be
unavailable, and in general havoc might be set loose in the current code.

As usual, start by running the specs and reading the results. Then fix some
things, run the tests again, and repeat.

You're probably pretty good at this right now â€” good luck!

## A Hint About `()`

Remember the purpose of using `()` is to call functions in JavaScript. It
essentially tells our code to *execute* the function. A function called without
a `()`, like simply `functionName`, will return the function definition but NOT
run it. You'll see the return value as `[Function: functionName]`.

To get our code to execute that function, we instead call `functionName()`,
which executes the code within that function.

As an example, the third test here at first returns: `Error: Expected [Function:
funkyFunction] to equal 'FUNKY!'`

We can make the function execute by saying this: `var theFunk = funkyFunction()`
But this returns ANOTHER FUNCTION definition! If you recall from the previous
lesson, a closure is when a function is returned by another function, allowing the
returned (inner) function to have access to variables declared inside the scope of the
original (outer) function.

```js
// An example closure
function outer() {
  var example = "Greetings "
  return function inner(name) {
    return example + name
  }
}

// greeting is assigned the definition of the inner function
var greeting = outer()

// we can then call greeting and pass in a string
greeting('Proffesor Falken')

// when called, greeting will combine the provided string with the 'example' variable defined in the outer function
// => "Greetings Proffesor Falken"
```

Notice in the above code, `outer()` is calle once, and its return value is
assigned to the `greeting` variable. The return value _is_ the `inner` function
definition. We never explicitly call `inner()` because its definition gets
assigned to `greeting`. Instead, we call `greeting()`!
